## 🌵 Branches

We use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. develop is the development branch.

2. master is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with feature and followed by feature name. (ie. feature/featurename-issuenumber)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.

**Steps to create a pull request**

1. Make a PR to develop branch.
2. It must pass all continuous integration checks and get positive reviews.
3. After this, changes will be merged to develop branch.
